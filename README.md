# Hospital Management System Using JavaFx
The purpose of this project is to implement a data management system of a hospital. This system provides the user with the ability to manage information about doctors, patients, their illnesses, their appointments, but also the treatment per appointment.

Below are some screenshots of the application's user interface.

**Good to know**
For the proper functioning of the system it is necessary to initially insert the diseases in which the doctors of the hospital specialize, since, when adding a doctor to the system, only one of the categories contained in the disease database can be selected as his specialty. With regard to patients and their appointments, the patient should first be added to the system and then an attempt should be made to register a new booking because, similarly to doctors and diseases, only patients who are in the hospital database are available for selection in the booking registration environment. After the user is sure that the above are met, he can perform any available action he wishes without unwanted errors.
